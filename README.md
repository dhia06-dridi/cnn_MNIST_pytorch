## Installation

To set up the environment, ensure you have Python installed and run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pillow
```

## Usage

1. **Dataset Download**: The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded when you run the script for the first time.

2. **Model Training**: Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs in the script, then train the CNN model on the MNIST training set.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the MNIST test set to display its accuracy.

4. **External Image Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify digits from custom images by setting the `image_path` variable to the file path of the image.

## Code Structure

- **Data Handling**: Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset using `torchvision`.
- **Model Architecture**: Defines a CNN model with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Training Pipeline**: Trains the model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and evaluates its performance on the test set.
- **Prediction Utility**: Includes a function to classify digits from external images, complete with preprocessing steps.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieves a high accuracy of approximately 99% on the MNIST test dataset.
- **Visualization**: Displays prediction probabilities for each class, offering insights into the modelâ€™s confidence levels.
