# MNIST Digit Classification with CNN in PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch. The model is trained, evaluated, and used to make predictions on external images.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pillow
```

## Usage

1. **Downloading Data**: The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded when the script is first run.

2. **Training the Model**: The CNN model is trained on the MNIST training set. You can adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the code.

3. **Evaluating the Model**: The model is evaluated on the MNIST test set, and the accuracy is displayed.

4. **Predicting External Images**: You can use the trained model to predict digits from external images by specifying the image path in the `image_path` variable.


## Code Structure

- **Data Loading**: The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized using `torchvision`.
- **Model Definition**: A CNN model is defined with convolutional and fully connected layers.
- **Training**: The model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and evaluated on the test set.
- **Prediction**: A function is provided to predict digits from external images.

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: The CNN model achieves high accuracy (e.g., ~99%) on the MNIST test set.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Predictions can be visualized with graphs showing probabilities for each class.

## Contributing
